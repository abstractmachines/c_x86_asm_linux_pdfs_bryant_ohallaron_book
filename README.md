# c_x86_asm_linux_pdfs_bryant_ohallaron_book
PDFs I created for the purpose of self teaching from the industry standard Bryant and O'Hallaron book, using the Kernigan Ritchie book as a guide.

 These are answers to the "homework questions" in the industry standard C books by Kernigan Ritchie and Bryant O'Hallaron. To run the code for these answers, I used x86, Linux, gdb, object dump, hex dump, and more.
